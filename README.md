# InteractionCheck
This is a mod for PAYDAY 2.
It changes the interaction script soo that you need to have direct sight of view with objects you're interacting with.
Some of the units are ignored.
If you happen to find a unit that you can't interact with despite having a direct sight of view, please make a report on the issues tab, with proper information, that is;
Where did it happen?
